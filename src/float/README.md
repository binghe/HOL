This is a directory for the floating point theories in Kananaskis-2
release of HOL-4. Originally developed in HOL Light, by John Harrison [1,2],
University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, 1998. Ported by Behzad
Akbarpour, Concordia University, Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering, February 2004.

The following is a brief listing of what's available.

     ieeeTheory    * Formalization of IEEE-754 standard for binary
                     floating-point arithmetic.
     floatTheory   * Useful properties of floating point numbers.

NOTE: This work has been superseded by the work in `src/floating-point` based
      on `wordsTheory`.
