# HOL's Probability Theory

This directory contains HOL4's Measure, Lebesgue integral and
Probability theories.

## Measure, Integral and Probability Theory defined on extended reals (new)

     extrealScript.sml     * The theory of Extended Real Numbers
     measureScript.sml     * Measure Theory defined on extended reals
     borelScript.sml       * Borel sets and Borel measurable functions
     lebesgueScript.sml    * The theory of Lebesgue Integral
     martingaleScript.sml  * The theory of martingales based on Ïƒ-finite filtered measure space

## Measure and Probability Theory defined on reals (old)

     real_measureScript.sml
     real_borelScript.sml
     real_lebesgueScript.sml
     real_probabilityScript.sml

(These old scripts are used by `examples/miller` and `examples/diningcryptos`)

## Elementary Topology in Euclidean Space (from hol-light)
