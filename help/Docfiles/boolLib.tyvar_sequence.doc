\TYPE {tyvar_sequence : int -> hol_type list}

\SYNOPSIS
Generates a canonical list of distinct type variables.

\DESCRIBE
A call to {tyvar_sequence n} generates a list consisting of {n}
distinct type variables, with early members of the sequence being
{:'a} (``alpha''), {:'b} (``beta'') etc. After the first 26 members of
the list, the remainder are of the form {:'a1}, {:'a2} etc.

\FAILURE
Never fails.  If {n} is negative the generated list is empty.

\EXAMPLE
{
> tyvar_sequence 3;
val it = [“:α”, “:β”, “:γ”] : hol_type list
}
