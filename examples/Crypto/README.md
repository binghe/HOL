# Formalization of Block Ciphers and Other Encryption Algorithms

This directory provides a collection of block ciphers 

  * AES [1]
  * IDEA [1]
  * MARS [1]
  * RC6 [1]
  * RSA
  * SHA-1
  * Serpent [1]
  * TEA [1]
  * TWOFISH [1]

(and their functional correctness proofs), plus some modes 
of operation (modesScript.sml). Also the hash algorithm SHA-1
has been formalized. A worked example in data encryption may 
be found in tea.data.encrypt.
